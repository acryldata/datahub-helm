# DataHub Kubernetes Helm Charts
[![Artifact Hub](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://artifacthub.io/badge/repository/datahub)](https://artifacthub.io/packages/search?repo=datahub)

## Introduction
[This repo](https://github.com/acryldata/datahub-helm) provides 
the Kubernetes [Helm](https://helm.sh/) charts for deploying 
[Datahub](https://github.com/linkedin/datahub) and it's dependencies 
(Elasticsearch, optionally Neo4j, MySQL, and Kafka) on a Kubernetes cluster.

## Setup
1. Set up a kubernetes cluster
   - In a cloud platform of choice like [Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks), 
     [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine), 
     and [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/) OR
   - In local environment using [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/). 
     Note, more than 7GB of RAM is required to run Datahub and it's dependencies 
2. Install the following tools: 
   - [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) to manage kubernetes resources
   - [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) to deploy the resources based on helm charts. 
     Note, we only support Helm 3.
   
## Components
Datahub consists of 4 main components: [GMS](https://datahubproject.io/docs/metadata-service/), 
[MAE Consumer](https://datahubproject.io/docs/metadata-jobs/mae-consumer-job) (optional), 
[MCE Consumer](https://datahubproject.io/docs/metadata-jobs/mce-consumer-job) (optional), and 
[Frontend](https://datahubproject.io/docs/datahub-frontend). Kubernetes deployment 
for each of the components are defined as subcharts under the main 
[Datahub](https://github.com/acryldata/datahub-helm/tree/master/charts/datahub) 
helm chart.

The main components are powered by 4 external dependencies:
- Kafka
- Local DB (MySQL, Postgres, MariaDB)
- Search Index (Elasticsearch)
- Graph Index (Supports either Neo4j or Elasticsearch)

The dependencies must be deployed before deploying Datahub. We created a separate 
[chart](https://github.com/acryldata/datahub-helm/tree/master/charts/prerequisites) 
for deploying the dependencies with example configuration. They could also be deployed 
separately on-prem or leveraged as managed services. To remove your dependency on Neo4j,
set enabled to false in the `datahub-kubernetes/prerequisites/values.yaml` file.
Then, override the `graph_service_impl` field in `datahub-kubernetes/datahub/values.yaml` to
have the value `elasticsearch` instead of `neo4j`.

## Quickstart
Assuming kubectl context points to the correct kubernetes cluster, first create kubernetes secrets that contain MySQL and Neo4j passwords. 

```(shell)
kubectl create secret generic mysql-secrets --from-literal=mysql-root-password=datahub
kubectl create secret generic neo4j-secrets --from-literal=neo4j-password=datahub --from-literal=NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/datahub
```

The above commands sets the passwords to "datahub" as an example. Change to any password of choice. 

Add datahub helm repo by running the following

```(shell)
helm repo add datahub https://helm.datahubproject.io/
```

Then, deploy the dependencies by running the following

```(shell)
helm install prerequisites datahub/datahub-prerequisites
```

Note, the above uses the default configuration defined [here](https://github.com/acryldata/datahub-helm/blob/master/charts/prerequisites/values.yaml). You can change any of the configuration and deploy by running the following command. 

```(shell)
helm install prerequisites datahub/datahub-prerequisites --values <<path-to-values-file>>
```

Run `kubectl get pods` to check whether all the pods for the dependencies are running. 
You should get a result similar to below.

```
NAME                                               READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
elasticsearch-master-0                             1/1     Running     0          62m
prerequisites-cp-schema-registry-cf79bfccf-kvjtv   2/2     Running     1          63m
prerequisites-kafka-0                              1/1     Running     2          62m
prerequisites-mysql-0                              1/1     Running     1          62m
prerequisites-neo4j-0                              1/1     Running     0          52m
prerequisites-zookeeper-0                          1/1     Running     0          62m
```

deploy Datahub by running the following

```(shell)
helm install datahub datahub/datahub
```

Values in [values.yaml](https://github.com/acryldata/datahub-helm/blob/master/charts/datahub/values.yaml) 
have been preset to point to the dependencies deployed using the [prerequisites](https://github.com/acryldata/datahub-helm/tree/master/charts/prerequisites) 
chart with release name "prerequisites". If you deployed the helm chart using a different release name, update the quickstart-values.yaml file accordingly before installing. 

Run `kubectl get pods` to check whether all the datahub pods are running. You should get a result similar to below.

```
NAME                                               READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE

prerequisites-mysql-0                              1/1     Running     1          97m
prerequisites-neo4j-0                              1/1     Running     0          88m
prerequisites-zookeeper-0                          1/1     Running     0          97m
```

You can run the following to expose the frontend locally. Note, you can find the pod name using the command above. 
In this case, the datahub-frontend pod name was `datahub-datahub-frontend-84c58df9f7-5bgwx`. 

```(shell)
kubectl port-forward <datahub-frontend pod name> 9002:9002
```

You should be able to access the frontend via http://localhost:9002. 

Once you confirm that the pods are running well, you can set up ingress for datahub-frontend 
to expose the 9002 port to the public.

## Default Credentials

There are a few keys and credentials created as part of the deployment using randomized values. They can be overridden using various configuration parameters.

Also consider changing the default credentials used by any of the underlying data stores pulled in by the companion helm chart for
the prerequisites. Refer to the upstream helm charts or point to your own managed data stores for these components.

### DataHub Login

For controlling the default admin password, see the following [configuration](charts/datahub/values.yaml#L36).

### Encryption Key

Used by the Play framework and GMS to encrypt secrets at the application level, this can be configured [here](charts/datahub/values.yaml#L579).

### Token Signing Key

Used to sign tokens for authentication, see configuration [here](charts/datahub/values.yaml#L605).
